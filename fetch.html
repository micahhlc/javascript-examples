      /*
Both loadDoc functions achieve the same goal, which is to fetch the content of "sample.txt" and display it in an element with the id "demo". 
However, there are some differences in their implementations:
Syntax: The first loadDoc function uses the async/await syntax, while the second one uses the Promise syntax with .then() and .catch().
Readability: The async/await syntax tends to be more concise and easier to read, especially for developers who are more familiar with 
synchronous programming. On the other hand, the .then() and .catch() syntax in the second function is more explicit about the asynchronous nature of the operation.
Error handling: In the first function, error handling is done implicitly with try/catch around the await statements. 
In the second function, error handling is done explicitly with the .catch() method.
Execution order: With async/await, the code reads more linearly, making it easier to reason about the execution order. 
In the second function, the code is more nested, which may make it slightly harder to follow.
In summary, both approaches are valid and have their own advantages. 
The choice between them often depends on personal preference and the specific requirements of the project. 
Some developers may prefer the simplicity and readability of async/await, while others may prefer the explicitness of .then() and .catch().
